Music player. Can download files, edit playlists, and play music with standard controls and keybinds. Designed for TTRPG usage, with future plans including multi-channel fadein/out between tracks for adaptive music control and better immersion. The goal is a more seamless experience than just pulling up videos on YouTube for ambience and hvaing to manually switch which is playing and when.
