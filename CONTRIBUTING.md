## Ways to Contribute

- **Coding Style**: Codebase is currently very messy. But it works. So whatever. Compartmentalizing code, even just reogranizing existing functions into more descriptive sections would be helpful.
- **Efficiency**: A lot of redundant code. Same as **Coding Style**.
- **Tests**: Currently no unit tests to ensure functionality.
